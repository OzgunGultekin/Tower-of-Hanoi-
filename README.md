# Tower of Hanoi

The Tower of Hanoi is a puzzle game conceived by the French mathematician Édouard Lucas.

▪  The game involves moving n disks of different diameters from an initial tower (rod) to a final tower, passing through an intermediate tower.

▪  Initially, all the disks are stacked on the initial tower, from largest to smallest.

▪ The rules for moving are as follows:

  -You can only move one disk at a time.
  
  -You can only move a disk onto an empty tower or onto a disk that is larger.

## Materials
- Java Programming Language
- Java Swing Library
- Java StdDraw Library
- IDE: IntelliJ / Eclipse
  
For this project, Java programming and IDE: IntelliJ / Eclipse are used for coding. Swing and StdDraw libraries are used for GUI and visualization.
Note: Make sure the libraries are installed.

## UI and GUI

The first GUI we encounter in the project is the screen where we will select the number of disks and the solution method.
