# Tower of Hanoi

The Tower of Hanoi is a puzzle game conceived by the French mathematician Édouard Lucas.

▪  The game involves moving n disks of different diameters from an initial tower (rod) to a final tower, passing through an intermediate tower.

▪  Initially, all the disks are stacked on the initial tower, from largest to smallest.

▪ The rules for moving are as follows:

  -You can only move one disk at a time.
  
  -You can only move a disk onto an empty tower or onto a disk that is larger.
